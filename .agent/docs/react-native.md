# Reference


### `autoCapitalize`

Tells `TextInput` to automatically capitalize certain characters. This property is not supported by some keyboard types such as `name-phone-pad`.

- `characters`: all characters.
- `words`: first letter of each word.
- `sentences`: first letter of each sentence (_default_).
- `none`: don't auto capitalize anything.

## `Animated` API

The [`Animated`](animated) API is designed to concisely express a wide variety of interesting animation and interaction patterns in a very performant way. `Animated` focuses on declarative relationships between inputs and outputs, with configurable transforms in between, and `start`/`stop` methods to control time-based animation execution.

`Animated` exports six animatable component types: `View`, `Text`, `Image`, `ScrollView`, `FlatList` and `SectionList`, but you can also create your own using `Animated.createAnimatedComponent()`.

For example, a container view that fades in when it is mounted may look like this:

<Tabs groupId="language" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultSnackLanguage} values={constants.snackLanguages}>
<TabItem value="javascript">

```SnackPlayer ext=js
import React, {useEffect, useRef} from 'react';
import {Animated, Text, View} from 'react-native';

const FadeInView = props => {
  const fadeAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current; // Initial value for opacity: 0

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 10000,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }).start();
  }, [fadeAnim]);

  return (
    <Animated.View // Special animatable View
      style={{
        ...props.style,
        opacity: fadeAnim, // Bind opacity to animated value
      }}>
      {props.children}
    </Animated.View>
  );
};

// You can then use your `FadeInView` in place of a `View` in your components:
export default () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}>
      <FadeInView
        style={{
          width: 250,
          height: 50,
          backgroundColor: 'powderblue',
        }}>
        <Text style={{fontSize: 28, textAlign: 'center', margin: 10}}>
          Fading in
        </Text>
      </FadeInView>
    </View>
  );
};
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="typescript">

```SnackPlayer ext=tsx
import React, {useEffect, useRef, type PropsWithChildren} from 'react';
import {Animated, Text, View, type ViewStyle} from 'react-native';

type FadeInViewProps = PropsWithChildren<{style: ViewStyle}>;

const FadeInView: React.FC<FadeInViewProps> = props => {
  const fadeAnim = useRef(new Animated.Value(0)).current; // Initial value for opacity: 0

  useEffect(() => {
    Animated.timing(fadeAnim, {
      toValue: 1,
      duration: 10000,
      useNativeDriver: true,
    }).start();
  }, [fadeAnim]);

  return (
    <Animated.View // Special animatable View
      style={{
        ...props.style,
        opacity: fadeAnim, // Bind opacity to animated value
      }}>
      {props.children}
    </Animated.View>
  );
};

// You can then use your `FadeInView` in place of a `View` in your components:
export default () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        flex: 1,
        alignItems: 'center',
        justifyContent: 'center',
      }}>
      <FadeInView
        style={{
          width: 250,
          height: 50,
          backgroundColor: 'powderblue',
        }}>
        <Text style={{fontSize: 28, textAlign: 'center', margin: 10}}>
          Fading in
        </Text>
      </FadeInView>
    </View>
  );
};
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Let's break down what's happening here. In the `FadeInView` render method, a new `Animated.Value` called `fadeAnim` is initialized with `useRef`. The opacity property on the `View` is mapped to this animated value. Behind the scenes, the numeric value is extracted and used to set opacity.

When the component mounts, the opacity is set to 0. Then, an easing animation is started on the `fadeAnim` animated value, which will update all of its dependent mappings (in this case, only the opacity) on each frame as the value animates to the final value of 1.

This is done in an optimized way that is faster than calling `setState` and re-rendering. Because the entire configuration is declarative, we will be able to implement further optimizations that serialize the configuration and runs the animation on a high-priority thread.


### Configuring animations

Animations are heavily configurable. Custom and predefined easing functions, delays, durations, decay factors, spring constants, and more can all be tweaked depending on the type of animation.

`Animated` provides several animation types, the most commonly used one being [`Animated.timing()`](animated#timing). It supports animating a value over time using one of various predefined easing functions, or you can use your own. Easing functions are typically used in animation to convey gradual acceleration and deceleration of objects.

By default, `timing` will use an easeInOut curve that conveys gradual acceleration to full speed and concludes by gradually decelerating to a stop. You can specify a different easing function by passing an `easing` parameter. Custom `duration` or even a `delay` before the animation starts is also supported.

For example, if we want to create a 2-second long animation of an object that slightly backs up before moving to its final position:

```tsx
Animated.timing(this.state.xPosition, {
  toValue: 100,
  easing: Easing.back(),
  duration: 2000,
  useNativeDriver: true,
}).start();
```

Take a look at the [Configuring animations](animated#configuring-animations) section of the `Animated` API reference to learn more about all the config parameters supported by the built-in animations.


## `LayoutAnimation` API

`LayoutAnimation` allows you to globally configure `create` and `update` animations that will be used for all views in the next render/layout cycle. This is useful for doing Flexbox layout updates without bothering to measure or calculate specific properties in order to animate them directly, and is especially useful when layout changes may affect ancestors, for example a "see more" expansion that also increases the size of the parent and pushes down the row below which would otherwise require explicit coordination between the components in order to animate them all in sync.

Note that although `LayoutAnimation` is very powerful and can be quite useful, it provides much less control than `Animated` and other animation libraries, so you may need to use another approach if you can't get `LayoutAnimation` to do what you want.

Note that in order to get this to work on **Android** you need to set the following flags via `UIManager`:

```tsx
UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);
```

```SnackPlayer name=LayoutAnimations
import React, {useState} from 'react';
import {
  NativeModules,
  LayoutAnimation,
  Text,
  TouchableOpacity,
  StyleSheet,
  View,
} from 'react-native';

const {UIManager} = NativeModules;

UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental &&
  UIManager.setLayoutAnimationEnabledExperimental(true);

export default function App() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({
    w: 100,
    h: 100,
  });

  const onPress = () => {
    // Animate the update
    LayoutAnimation.spring();
    setState({w: state.w + 15, h: state.h + 15});
  };

  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      <View style={[styles.box, {width: state.w, height: state.h}]} />
      <TouchableOpacity onPress={onPress}>
        <View style={styles.button}>
          <Text style={styles.buttonText}>Press me!</Text>
        </View>
      </TouchableOpacity>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  box: {
    width: 200,
    height: 200,
    backgroundColor: 'red',
  },
  button: {
    backgroundColor: 'black',
    paddingHorizontal: 20,
    paddingVertical: 15,
    marginTop: 15,
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: '#fff',
    fontWeight: 'bold',
  },
});
```

This example uses a preset value, you can customize the animations as you need, see [LayoutAnimation.js](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/main/packages/react-native/Libraries/LayoutAnimation/LayoutAnimation.js) for more information.


### `capInsets` <div className="label ios">iOS</div>

When the image is resized, the corners of the size specified by `capInsets` will stay a fixed size, but the center content and borders of the image will be stretched. This is useful for creating resizable rounded buttons, shadows, and other resizable assets. More info in the [official Apple documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UIKit/Reference/UIImage_Class/index.html#//apple_ref/occ/instm/UIImage/resizableImageWithCapInsets).

## Prerequisites

Follow the guide on [setting up your development environment](set-up-your-environment) and using [React Native without a framework](getting-started-without-a-framework) to configure your development environment for building React Native apps for iOS.
This guide also assumes you're familiar with the basics of iOS development such as creating a `UIViewController` and editing the `Podfile` file.


## 2. Install NPM dependencies

Go to the root directory and run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="shell">
{`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/template/refs/heads/${getTemplateBranchNameForCurrentVersion()}/template/package.json`}
</CodeBlock>

This will copy the `package.json` <RNTemplateRepoLink href="template/package.json">file from the Community template</RNTemplateRepoLink> to your project.

Next, install the NPM packages by running:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultPackageManager} values={constants.packageManagers}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Installation process has created a new `node_modules` folder. This folder stores all the JavaScript dependencies required to build your project.

Add `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore` file (here the <RNTemplateRepoLink href="template/_gitignore">Community default one</RNTemplateRepoLink>).


### 3. Install Development tools


## 7. Passing initial props to the React Native view

In some case, you'd like to pass some information from the Native app to JavaScript. For example, you might want to pass the user id of the currently logged user to React Native, together with a token that can be used to retrieve information from a database.

This is possible by using the `initialProperties` parameter of the `view(withModuleName:initialProperty)` overload of the `RCTReactNativeFactory` class. The following steps shows you how to do it.


### Update the App.tsx file to read the initial properties.

Open the `App.tsx` file and add the following code:

```diff title="App.tsx"
import {
  Colors,
  DebugInstructions,
  Header,
  ReloadInstructions,
} from 'react-native/Libraries/NewAppScreen';

-function App(): React.JSX.Element {
+function App(props): React.JSX.Element {
  const isDarkMode = useColorScheme() === 'dark';

  const backgroundStyle = {
    backgroundColor: isDarkMode ? Colors.darker : Colors.lighter,
  };

  return (
    <SafeAreaView style={backgroundStyle}>
      <StatusBar
        barStyle={isDarkMode ? 'light-content' : 'dark-content'}
        backgroundColor={backgroundStyle.backgroundColor}
      />
      <ScrollView
        contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior="automatic"
        style={backgroundStyle}>
        <Header />
-       <View
-         style={{
-           backgroundColor: isDarkMode
-             ? Colors.black
-             : Colors.white,
-           padding: 24,
-         }}>
-         <Text style={styles.title}>Step One</Text>
-         <Text>
-           Edit <Text style={styles.bold}>App.tsx</Text> to
-           change this screen and see your edits.
-         </Text>
-         <Text style={styles.title}>See your changes</Text>
-         <ReloadInstructions />
-         <Text style={styles.title}>Debug</Text>
-         <DebugInstructions />
+         <Text style={styles.title}>UserID: {props.userID}</Text>
+         <Text style={styles.title}>Token: {props.token}</Text>
        </View>
      </ScrollView>
    </SafeAreaView>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  title: {
    fontSize: 24,
    fontWeight: '600',
+   marginLeft: 20,
  },
  bold: {
    fontWeight: '700',
  },
});

export default App;
```

These changes will tell React Native that your App component is now accepting some properties. The `RCTreactNativeFactory` will take care of passing them to the component when it's rendered.


### Update the Native code to pass the initial properties to JavaScript.

<Tabs groupId="ios-language" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultAppleLanguage} values={constants.appleLanguages}>
<TabItem value="objc">

Modify the `ReactViewController.mm` to pass the initial properties to JavaScript.

```diff title="ReactViewController.mm"
 - (void)viewDidLoad {
   [super viewDidLoad];
   // Do any additional setup after loading the view.

   _factoryDelegate = [ReactNativeFactoryDelegate new];
   _factoryDelegate.dependencyProvider = [RCTAppDependencyProvider new];
   _factory = [[RCTReactNativeFactory alloc] initWithDelegate:_factoryDelegate];
-  self.view = [_factory.rootViewFactory viewWithModuleName:@"HelloWorld"];
+  self.view = [_factory.rootViewFactory viewWithModuleName:@"HelloWorld" initialProperties:@{
+    @"userID": @"12345678",
+    @"token": @"secretToken"
+  }];
}
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="swift">

Modify the `ReactViewController.swift` to pass the initial properties to the React Native view.

```diff title="ReactViewController.swift"
  override func viewDidLoad() {
    super.viewDidLoad()
    reactNativeFactoryDelegate = ReactNativeDelegate()
    reactNativeFactoryDelegate!.dependencyProvider = RCTAppDependencyProvider()
    reactNativeFactory = RCTReactNativeFactory(delegate: reactNativeFactoryDelegate!)
-   view = reactNativeFactory!.rootViewFactory.view(withModuleName: "HelloWorld")
+   view = reactNativeFactory!.rootViewFactory.view(withModuleName: "HelloWorld" initialProperties: [
+     "userID": "12345678",
+     "token": "secretToken"
+])

  }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

3. Run your app once again. You should see the following screen after you present the `ReactViewController`:

<center>
  <img src="/docs/assets/brownfield-with-initial-props.png" width="30%" height="30%"/>
</center>


### `initialNumToRender`

How many items to render in the initial batch. This should be enough to fill the screen but not much more. Note these items will never be unmounted as part of the windowed rendering in order to improve perceived performance of scroll-to-top actions.

| Type   | Default |
| ------ | ------- |
| number | `10`    |

---


### `initialScrollIndex`

Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at `initialScrollIndex`. This disables the "scroll to top" optimization that keeps the first `initialNumToRender` items always rendered and immediately renders the items starting at this initial index. Requires `getItemLayout` to be implemented.

| Type   |
| ------ |
| number |

---


### `viewabilityConfigCallbackPairs`

List of `ViewabilityConfig`/`onViewableItemsChanged` pairs. A specific `onViewableItemsChanged` will be called when its corresponding `ViewabilityConfig`'s conditions are met. See `ViewabilityHelper.js` for flow type and further documentation.

| Type                                   |

## Methods


#### 2. If the app is not already open, it is opened and the url is passed in as the initialURL

You can handle these events with `Linking.getInitialURL()` - it returns a Promise that resolves to the URL, if there is one.

---


## Methods


### `getInitialURL()`

```tsx
static getInitialURL(): Promise<string | null>;
```

If the app launch was triggered by an app link, it will give the link url, otherwise it will give `null`.

:::info
To support deep linking on Android, refer https://developer.android.com/training/app-indexing/deep-linking.html#handling-intents.
:::

:::tip
`getInitialURL` may return `null` when Remote JS Debugging is active. Disable the debugger to ensure it gets passed.
:::

---


### `openSettings()`

```tsx
static openSettings(): Promise<void>;
```

Open the Settings app and displays the app’s custom settings, if it has any.

---


## Methods

When the given value is a ValueXY instead of a Value, each config option may be a vector of the form `{x: ..., y: ...}` instead of a scalar.


## Prerequisites

Follow the guide on [setting up your development environment](set-up-your-environment) and using [React Native without a framework](getting-started-without-a-framework) to configure your development environment for building React Native apps for Android.
This guide also assumes you're familiar with the basics of Android development such as creating Activities and editing the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.


## 2. Install NPM dependencies

Go to the root directory and run the following command:

<CodeBlock language="bash" title="shell">
{`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/react-native-community/template/refs/heads/${getTemplateBranchNameForCurrentVersion()}/template/package.json`}
</CodeBlock>

This will copy the `package.json` <RNTemplateRepoLink href="template/package.json">file from the Community template</RNTemplateRepoLink> to your project.

Next, install the NPM packages by running:

<Tabs groupId="package-manager" queryString defaultValue={constants.defaultPackageManager} values={constants.packageManagers}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```shell
yarn install
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Installation process has created a new `node_modules` folder. This folder stores all the JavaScript dependencies required to build your project.

Add `node_modules/` to your `.gitignore` file (here the <RNTemplateRepoLink href="template/_gitignore">Community default one</RNTemplateRepoLink>).


## Getting Started

To enable push notifications, [configure your notifications with Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server) and your server-side system.

Then, [enable remote notifications](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app#2980038) in your project. This will automatically enable the required settings.


## Methods


### `getInitialNotification()`

```tsx
static getInitialNotification(): Promise<PushNotification | null>;
```

This method returns a promise. If the app was launched by a push notification, this promise resolves to an object of type `PushNotificationIOS` for the notification that was tapped. Otherwise, it resolves to `null`.
